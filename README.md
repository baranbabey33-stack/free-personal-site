## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

This website is designed for easy personalization:

1.  **Content:**
    * Open `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, and `contact.html`.
    * Replace all placeholder text like `[Your Name]`, `[YourBrand]`, `yourusername`, `your.email@example.com`, and project descriptions with your actual information.
2.  **Images:**
    * The current images are directly linked from external URLs. For better performance and control, it's highly recommended to:
        * Download high-quality images relevant to your content.
        * Place them in the `assets/images/` folder.
        * Update the `src` attributes in your HTML files (e.g., `<img src="assets/images/your-profile-pic.jpg">`) and `url()` paths in `assets/css/style.css` (for the hero background) to point to your local images.
3.  **Colors & Fonts:**
    * Modify the CSS variables in `assets/css/style.css` (`:root` section) to change the primary, secondary, accent, and background colors. This will instantly update the entire theme.
    * Change the `font-family` properties to use different Google Fonts if desired.
4.  **Typing Effect:**
    * Edit the `strings` array in `assets/js/script.js` to customize the text that appears in the typing effect (e.g., `["a Data Scientist.", "an AI Specialist."]` ).
5.  **Favicon:**
    * Generate your own favicon set (e.g., using [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)) and replace the files in `assets/images/`.
